# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description
Passwords are important to protect sensitive information on websites that we use. Everyone needs a strong, random password to prevent unwanted access to sites used everyday. A password generator is one way to accomplish this. Strong passwords will include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. They will also be between 8 and 128 characters long. Combining all of these elements together will result in a strong, random password that is less likely to be guessed by an unfamiliar user.
